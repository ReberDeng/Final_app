In addition to the framework structure using DCloud's open source framework Uni-app and Vue.js public library, all the rest of the pages, styles, functions and interfaces are independently developed by me. 

The project is based on [Uni-app](https://github.com/dcloudio/uni-app) 

the core file is in

```
src\pages
src\api
src\App.vue
```
